Fan regulator mainboard/PCB to replace *SAAB 9-3 1998-2003* faulty regulator at reasonnable costs. #36 on diagram below

Due to high heating functioning TÂ° of main MOSFET on board, it ends in failing and board/soldering pads may be damaged as well as components.

This is made to replace PCB and its components, you need to take back from original SAAB part #5045158 :
  - wiring
  - housing and screws
  - vertical plate on PCB

Inital intention was to replace faulty part but after a close magnified look that showed the damage, I ended to make a complete 1:1 copy of original board layout under Eagle CAD.
Schematic & board design are available here.
Ordering PCB is possible at OSHPark (note that they sell boards by sets of minimum 3)
