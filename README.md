This is made to replace PCB only, you need to take wiring and housing back from original SAAB part.

Due to high heating functioning TÂ° of main MOSFET on board, it ends in failing and board/soldering pads may be damaged as well as components.

With a close magnified look I ended to make a complete 1:1 copy of original board layout under Eagle CAD.
